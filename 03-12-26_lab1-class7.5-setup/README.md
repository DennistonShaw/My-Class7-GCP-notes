# Verify Tool Installation

Open the command line tool for your machine and run the below commands to ensure everything is working.

1. `python --version`
   - did not install with the provided code
   - run `brew install python`

The problem is Apple removed the python command and only supports python3 so check with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

2. `terraform --version`

3. `gcloud version`
